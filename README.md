# XR-Manual

PieceByPiece is a transformative XR project designed to assist users in assembling furniture with ease and precision. Leveraging mixed reality technology, it offers a significant advancement over traditional assembly manuals, which often suffer from confusing instructions and unclear illustrations. Our solution provides step-by-step guidance through interactive 3D models. The AR component offers a hands-on guide with life-size visuals, enabling users to follow the process effortlessly. Additionally, the VR feature presents the assembly in exploded views, aiding in the identification and rectification of errors. PieceByPiece aims to eliminate the common frustrations associated with DIY furniture assembly from retailers like Walmart or Home Depot, offering an innovative and user-friendly alternative.

We first tested all the interaction modes we can do without a controller on quest 3. Based on that, we designed our User experience and UI interface. Then we test each part of design to make iterations of them.
